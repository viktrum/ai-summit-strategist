    "description": "Global policy discourse largely treats AI and DPI separately. AI discussions focus on model safety, compute governance, workforce displacement. DPI conversations center on digital identity, digital payment, data exchange. AI-DPI convergence can create exponential value and new risk categories. While this convergence accelerates, critical questions remain: How can DPI lower barriers for local AI innovation while preventing new forms of exclusion? How can responsible AI systems be built in resource-constrained environments using DPI approaches?",

Power demand from global data centers is projected to rise 50–165% by 2030, largely due to AI.\n\nThe AI era is forcing a fundamental redesign-native HVDC distribution + liquid cooling will make high-density, sustainable AI infrastructure possible at scale, dramatically cutting losses, material use, and operational costs compared to legacy designs. The transition is already underway among hyperscalers and will become standard within 3–5 years.\n\nVelankani Group is a leader in making Indigenous AI Data Center Infrastructure which will cater the demand for the Future.",
