This research session brings together cutting-edge work from various research, corporate and governance institutions to demonstrate how understanding social norms - the unwritten rules of culture - is essential for building AI systems that are not just accurate, but trusted, adopted, and effective in local communities.",

    "title": "AI for Fraud Prevention and Financial Inclusion in BFSI",
    "description": "This panel explores how, as BFSI systems expand through digital onboarding, payments, and credit, trust can no longer rely on manual oversight or fragmented rule-based controls. It examines AI as a core trust infrastructure—enabling real-time fraud prevention, advanced risk intelligence, and resilient cross-border controls—while ensuring explainability, privacy, auditability, and fairness. The discussion also highlights how AI-driven trust rails reduce friction and unlock financial inclusion at scale for underserved citizens and MSMEs.",

    "description": "As large language models (LLMs) push toward trillion-parameter frontiers, training at extreme scale demands unprecedented compute efficiency, resilience, and orchestration across thousands of GPUs. This NVIDIA session reveals how the NeMo Framework - leveraging Megatron-Core for tensor, pipeline, sequence, expert parallelism, FP8 precision, and multi-data center support - enables 96% scaling efficiency on 3,072+ H100/H200 GPUs, as demonstrated in Nemotron-4 340B training across distant sites. NVIDIA's Blackwell platform and GB200 NVL72 systems supercharge this with 30x faster real-time inference, disaggregated serving via Dynamo for prefill/decode optimization, and resilient features like auto-failover on DGX Cloud for <1% downtime at 10K-GPU scales. Attendees will gain actionable insights into post-training scaling laws, synthetic data generation, reinforcement learning, and JAX-based horizontal scaling to 10,000+ GPUs, powering next-gen AI from GTC 2025/2026 innovations.",

    "description": "Artificial Intelligence has rapidly achieved technical maturity across its first two developmental levels, yet organizational maturity has not kept pace. This panel examines the critical gap between AI capability and institutional readiness. It will explore how targeted capacity building, across leadership, workforce, governance, and processes, can unlock AI's full value. The discussion focuses on activating impact from the bottom of the value chain, ensuring AI adoption translates into measurable outcomes rather than isolated technological success.",
