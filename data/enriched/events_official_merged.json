Yet biased datasets, exclusionary design choices, and uneven deployment risk reinforcing inequities and disproportionately harming already marginalised communities, including the elderly, persons with disabilities, and rural populations. This interdisciplinary panel will explore inclusive AI strategies, such as participatory design, representative data practices, and context-sensitive governance frameworks, to ensure that AI systems in healthcare are designed, developed, and deployed in ways that mitigate unintended harm.

This NVIDIA session reveals how the NeMo Framework - leveraging Megatron-Core for tensor, pipeline, sequence, expert parallelism, FP8 precision, and multi-data center support - enables 96% scaling efficiency on 3,072+ H100/H200 GPUs, as demonstrated in Nemotron-4 340B training across distant sites. NVIDIA's Blackwell platform and GB200 NVL72 systems supercharge this with 30x faster real-time inference, disaggregated serving via Dynamo for prefill/decode optimization, and resilient features like auto-failover on DGX Cloud for <1% downtime at 10K-GPU scales. Attendees will gain actionable insights into post-training scaling laws, synthetic data generation, reinforcement learning, and JAX-based horizontal scaling to 10,000+ GPUs, powering next-gen AI from GTC 2025/2026 innovations.",

Power demand from global data centers is projected to rise 50–165% by 2030, largely due to AI.\n\nThe AI era is forcing a fundamental redesign-native HVDC distribution + liquid cooling will make high-density, sustainable AI infrastructure possible at scale, dramatically cutting losses, material use, and operational costs compared to legacy designs. The transition is already underway among hyperscalers and will become standard within 3–5 years.\n\nVelankani Group is a leader in making Indigenous AI Data Center Infrastructure which will cater the demand for the Future.",
