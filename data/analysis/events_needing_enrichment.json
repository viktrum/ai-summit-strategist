Yet data sovereignty rules prevent collective use of genomic datasets, widening the Global AI Divide. Data visitation—where algorithms travel securely to data rather than data moving to researchers—offers a path forward. This workshop convenes policymakers, technologists, and public health leaders to explore governance, standards, and technologies, showcasing how emerging tools translate policy into deployable infrastructure built with the Global South.",

Power demand from global data centers is projected to rise 50–165% by 2030, largely due to AI.\n\nThe AI era is forcing a fundamental redesign-native HVDC distribution + liquid cooling will make high-density, sustainable AI infrastructure possible at scale, dramatically cutting losses, material use, and operational costs compared to legacy designs. The transition is already underway among hyperscalers and will become standard within 3–5 years.\n\nVelankani Group is a leader in making Indigenous AI Data Center Infrastructure which will cater the demand for the Future.",
