    "description": "AI systems deployed across diverse cultural contexts often fail not because of technical limitations, but because they overlook social norms—the unwritten rules that shape human behaviour and decision-making. A recommendation system that succeeds in the United States may not resonate in India. A health chatbot that effectively engages American users may alienate Indian communities if it does not reflect local expectations and communication styles. This research-focused session convenes leading scholarship and applied work examining how culturally grounded design, local data partnerships, and participatory methods can improve AI performance across contexts. The emphasis is on embedding social understanding into model development to ensure effectiveness, legitimacy, and equitable impact across geographies.",

Power demand from global data centers is projected to rise 50–165% by 2030, largely due to AI.\n\nThe AI era is forcing a fundamental redesign-native HVDC distribution + liquid cooling will make high-density, sustainable AI infrastructure possible at scale, dramatically cutting losses, material use, and operational costs compared to legacy designs. The transition is already underway among hyperscalers and will become standard within 3–5 years.\n\nVelankani Group is a leader in making Indigenous AI Data Center Infrastructure which will cater the demand for the Future.",
