## Issues & Recommendations

### ⚠️ Too Many Subcategories

**Current:** 623 subcategories
**Target:** ~100 subcategories
**Overage:** 523 extra (523% over target)

**Problem:** Many subcategories are overlapping or could be merged.

**Solutions:**
1. **Re-run with stricter consolidation** - Force AI to create max 8-12 subcategories per category
2. **Manual merge** - Review duplicates listed above and merge similar ones
3. **Accept higher count** - Keep ~600 subcategories if granularity is valuable

### Suggested Next Steps

- [ ] **Option A:** Re-run hierarchy builder with max subcategory limit (8-12 per category = ~100 total)
- [ ] **Option B:** Manually consolidate duplicates and accept ~200-300 subcategories
- [ ] **Option C:** Accept current 623 subcategories (more granular matching)

---

## Approval Checklist

**After reviewing:**

- [ ] **APPROVED AS-IS** - Proceed with 623 subcategories
- [ ] **RE-RUN WITH LIMITS** - Specify max subcategories per category
- [ ] **NEEDS MANUAL FIXES** - Specify which subcategories to merge
